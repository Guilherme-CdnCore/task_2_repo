It was used in a static fire test but was never employed for a launch, and was abandoned due to range scheduling conflicts arising from overflying other active pads.",1,0,830b765527343fb23f5f11f6506841274e03b87d

Previously used alongside SLC-41 to launch Titan rockets for the US Air Force, the pad was heavily damaged by the AMOS-6 anomaly in September 2016. It returned to flight with CRS-13 on December 15, 2017, boasting an upgraded throwback-style Transporter-Erector modeled after that at LC-39A.",1,99,51b28f48682265c05dd8efa75cc08bbd265e5106
5e9e4502f5090927f8566f85,STLS,SpaceX South Texas Launch Site,Boca Chica Village,Texas,25.9972641,-97.1560845,under construction,0,0,America/Chicago,"SpaceX's new private launch site currently under construction for suborbital test flights of Starship, and potentially orbital flights of the full super heavy stack (previously referred to as BFR) in the future. Currently planned to enter use with static fires and test hops of the Starhopper, with the first tethered hop successfully occurring in March 2019. It was previously going to be used for Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy flights, but this no longer appears to be likely due to its construction timeline and existing launch sites being sufficient to handle present demand. Due to the Caribbean islands and off-shore oil wells, it will be limited to very few possible launch trajectories, and current Texas law only allows a limited number of beach closures per year for orbital launches.",0,0,2db97750a4bc3e6d46186a8d6037cef407b8844b

It would have also been the launch site of the Falcon 1e and the Falcon 9, but it was abandoned as SpaceX ended the Falcon 1 program and decided against upgrading it to support Falcon 9, likely due to its remote location and ensuing logistics complexities.",1,5,a75692c0cdda53d448a93d65a75d0fbf84c3e8a8

The pad was used for the debut of Falcon 9 v1.1 in the rocket's first ever non-dragon mission, CASSIOPE, in September 2013. It is SpaceX's only remaining pad with the old-style transporter/erector, which reclines prior to launch instead of using a throwback procedure. It is also capable of launching Falcon Heavy (although some pad modifications would be needed, but no west coast Falcon Heavy missions are currently planned).",1,28,d38dac6a416fe67f63a3cdf9bb61c75ae836d92a

SpaceX initially leased solely for Falcon Heavy and Crew Dragon launches, but the company has also used it for others as well following the damage to SLC-40 in the AMOS-6 explosion. After completing the necessary modifications, the first launch SpaceX performed on the pad was CRS-10 in February 2017. After SLC-40 was back online, 39A was upgraded to support Falcon Heavy and complete the removal of the shuttle-era Rotating Service Structure. More recently, a crew access arm and other safety equipment has been installed in order to launch commercial crew missions. 39A also occasionally launches other Falcon 9 missions between Falcon Heavy and Crew Dragon launches, depending on pad scheduling. The pad may also potentially be upgraded in the future for use with the BFR.",2,55,70bc0b306acf9aa04871988160c1df7a166760e3
